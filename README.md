The binary is called 'moneymachine' and the goal is to find the UAF bug, exploit it and be able to afford the legendary items ^_^.
This was inspired by 2x things, firstly the binary is a hommage to the degen game Runscape, and secondly, the name "moneymachine" is a reference to the GenZ meme kings 100gecs song "money machine". 

Thank u xx
